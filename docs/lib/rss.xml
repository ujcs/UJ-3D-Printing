 <br><br>
<br>Setting up an outlook calendar event and adding a resource
<br>Physical signup sheet (I suggest doing this as well as an indicator, and so if your print is done and you aren't around, and someone else needs to use, they quickly know who to contact.)
<br>Look at the introduction steps below!
<br><br>
<br>Take a look at demo's that have been printed on the computer using a variety of shapes, sizes, techniques, nozzles, purpose, etc.
<br>If you are familiar with Github, feel free to add your own with a pull request on the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/" target="_blank">UJ-3D-Printing repository</a>!
<br>Bambu Studio:<br>
<br>Download link: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio" target="_blank">https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio</a>

<br>Should be installed on the "Majors Lab" computers


<br>3D Printer is set in LAN mode, so must be on UJ network and then should be able to "add printer" from within Bambu Studio.

<br>Any additional instructions will be added here.


<br>You can add your own print files, find online models using the studio or externally, etc.

 <br>The printer, the rest we will try to keep some on hand, but if planning to print larger pieces (or dense - using a lot of filament), please ask or purchase your own. (Or see if we can purchase it for you and work with the business office.)<br>We will keep the following on-hand as general use:<br>
<br>Spare parts/nozzles/grease
<br>Smooth and textured plates for printing on
<br>Glue sticks (Very important for bed adhesion!)
<br>3D Printer and AMS

<br>Bambu X1C with AMS

 <br>The default nozzle is 0.4mm in side.<br>
<br>*This seems to work for most. One example of printing a card tray, with no fine details, switching from .04mm to .06mm would reduce print time from 4hr 1min to 3hrs 36min with no decernable difference in quality. You can test different nozzle impacts prior to actually changing.
<br>Nozzle sizes available for the Bambu X1C Printer:<br>
<br>0.2mm hotend

<br>Dr. B's note: this can be pesky, really easy to get "string" results, stuck supports, etc. Expect a higher level of ef


<br>0.4mm (default, spare nozzle on hand)
<br>0.6mm hotend
<br>0.8mm hotend

 <br>With the AMS it is quick and easy to print with multiple colors! Make sure you have considered the following before designing and printing in multiple colors:<br>
<br>Am I going to paint this?

<br>If you are going to further process after painting - select a base color such as grey, white, or black.


<br>Does it need to be in multiple colors?

<br>Every color switch can add significant time to a print and additional waste material generated.


<br>Do I have access to the colors (or something close) that I want?

<br>Too many colors, even if you have them all on hand (more than 4) can mean pausing, manual filament changes, etc., which all add to risk of something going wrong with a print in addition to the increase time mentioned.

- If you are familiar with Github (or wish to learn it, which is a great idea anyways), <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/" target="_blank">go to our repository</a>!<br>
- Wiki is maintained using Obsidian and a plugin that exports the site to HTML, however, that doesn't mean you need to learn or use any of those tools! Everything is stored in Markdown format - so individual files can be updated directly in the "<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://obsidian.md/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian Vault</a>," and then pull in when I integrate changes and repush the site to Github!<br>When in doubt, send a note to one of the faculty members and we will get you pointed in the right direction]]></description><link>http://3d.barnard.phd/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Index.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dr. Jakob E.
