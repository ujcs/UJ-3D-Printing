<br>3D Printer is bound to a shared login account (LAN mode with network settings wasn't playing nice).

<br>In Bambu Studio, you will need to log into the UJ Account:

<br>Username and Password can be located underneath the QR code
<br>This should periodically change. 
<br>Make sure to log out once complete as I was not able to test the impact of multiple people accessing the printer via multiple mobile and desktop apps - I presume it is a great way to mess things up.

<br>Utilizing Bambu Studio, set up your print!

<br>Make sure to use the glue stick on the chosen plate

<br>In Bambu studio you would have chosen the type of plate, textured PEI or Smooth PEI are your options. (I typically used the textured unless I knowingly wanted a smooth surface.)

<br>Plate is held down by magnets. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://youtu.be/auzXwvHsH2M?si=rz5c0y0iUIJLG1U9&amp;t=299" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://youtu.be/auzXwvHsH2M?si=rz5c0y0iUIJLG1U9&amp;t=299" target="_blank">Remove the plate</a>, add glue stick (helps with removing print once done), place back on the bed, and go!




<br>Print - make note of estimated completion time

<br>The estimates are pretty accurate.
<br>Plate changes are not automatic and often print one at a time sort of thing.
<br>If logged into mobile app you can get completion time alerts, remote monitoring, etc. If it isn't your print, avoid doing this so you don't mess things up for someone else by accident!


<br>Check back in and clean up once done

<br>Wash any residual glue off of plate
<br>Clean up any excess filament 
<br>Let a faculty know if there were any issues, running low on filament, leaving any personal filament, need additional time, etc.
<br>Log out of Desktop or Mobile app

 <br>The printer, the rest we will try to keep some on hand, but if planning to print larger pieces (or dense - using a lot of filament), please ask or purchase your own. (Or see if we can purchase it for you and work with the business office.)<br>We will keep the following on-hand as general use:<br>
<br>Spare parts/nozzles/grease
<br>Smooth and textured plates for printing on
<br>Glue sticks (Very important for bed adhesion!)
<br>3D Printer and AMS

<br>Bambu X1C with AMS 


<br>A small amount of tools, sanding material, and basic supplies we will try to keep on hand. Depending on how quickly those go missing, get used up, etc., they may or may not be available.
<br>Superglue (maybe)

 <br><br>
<br>If you are going past 5-6hrs of print time, ask. You might want to get your own.
<br>You want a specific color that isn't available or is showing as low, you might want to get your own.
<br>You want something other than PLA. (Also ask so we can review this with you.)
<br><br>
<br>At this time we don't keep any hardware for models on hand, so depending on the project you might want (or need) to get additional hardware. That could be...:

<br>Magnets (helps hold things together)
<br>Superglue (may be a small amount in the bins)
<br>Hinges or other such hardware
<br>Paint, plastic filler (some on hand), primer, etc.


<br><br>
<br>You may want a Micro SD Card to use for printing files, or<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/Timelapse#:~:text=How%20to%20enable%20timelapse,tower%20to%20clean%20the%20nozzle." rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/Timelapse#:~:text=How%20to%20enable%20timelapse,tower%20to%20clean%20the%20nozzle." target="_blank"> saving Timelapse videos</a> of your 3D prints.

<br>Note, the linked guide talks about turning on smooth mode. Every print I checked this option out, it added a significant amount of time to the print or what seemed to be little to no benefit to me. I highly suggest you leave in the default traditional mode.

 <br>At this time, there is not a Micro SD Card installed to record timelapse video, but I hope to track one down and get it installed soon.

 <br>The default nozzle is 0.4mm (this works for most things).<br>
<br>*This seems to work for most. One example of printing a card tray, with no fine details, switching from .04mm to .06mm would reduce print time from 4hr 1min to 3hrs 36min with no discernable difference in quality. You can test different nozzle impacts prior to actually changing.
<br>Nozzle sizes available for the Bambu X1C Printer:<br>
<br>0.2mm hotend

<br>Dr. B's note: this can be pesky, really easy to get "string" results, stuck supports, etc. Expect a higher level of ef


<br>0.4mm (default, spare nozzle on hand)
<br>0.6mm hotend
<br>0.8mm hotend
<br>You decided you do need to swap the Nozzle - here are the steps and links to videos demonstrating how to do it:<br>
<br>Swapping the Bambu Carbon X1C hotend: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f8XW8zZSRo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f8XW8zZSRo</a> (Note both videos will give you the idea, both also include a nozzle replacement, which you shouldn't have to do, just swap the complete hotend for the desired size.)

<br>Take off cover from hotend (magnets hold it there)
<br>Remove 2 screws holding it in place and pull down

<br>The wrench for this will be in the parts box. 


<br>Remove 3 plugs holding it in place (carefully)
<br>Place new nozzle and reverse the above process

 <br>With the AMS it is quick and easy to print with multiple colors! Make sure you have considered the following before designing and printing in multiple colors:<br>
<br>Am I going to paint this?

<br>If you are going to further process after painting - select a base color such as grey, white, or black.


<br>Does it need to be in multiple colors?

<br>Every color switch can add significant time to a print and additional waste material generated.


<br>Do I have access to the colors (or something close) that I want?

<br>Too many colors, even if you have them all on hand (more than 4) can mean pausing, manual filament changes, etc., which all add to risk of something going wrong with a print in addition to the increase time mentioned.

 <br><br>
<br>While some were printed with UJ Dept filament, most were printed with filament purchasing as I didn't want to use up all of the "small project" filament for folks! It doesn't seem like most of these use a lot, but it does add up!
<br>I only used the PLA Filament type ordered from Bambu directly.

<br>UJ has an account there, so can order non-tax.
<br>Bambu reels have an RFID chip in them, so Bambu Studio automatically recognized type and color.
<br>If purchasing your own, see Filament page in the Materials Needed section. In theory any generic 1.75mm filament should work, but your mileage may vary and I have erred on the side of the "certified to work with this printer" stuff from Bambu... but there are neat colors and types from elsewhere.


<br>My "personal stash" of filament order was:

<br>With "bulk" order (over 4), discount, and no tax added, this was around $125 USD of filament, which should last a while. My demo'd listed here below utilized some of the gray/white/black/orange of the department, so likely will go through more filament when using my own stuff. So consider how much you will need, how long it will take to order, etc.

<br>We are still working out how to best "stock" or allow usage of filament. How much should just be accepted as cost of running, when to tell folks they need to order, contribute to cost, etc.




<br>PLA Galaxy Nebula

<br>Liked the color and effect, but glitter higher risk of clogs so didn't use anything smaller than the .4mm nozzle.




<br>PLA Red
<br>PLA Blue
<br>PLA Yellow

<br>Accidentally got the refill one, so had to get creative with respooling on the extra galaxy reel.




<br>With the demo projects, I aimed to use a variety of shapes, length of prints, fine detail vs larger assembled, etc. Much of what I printed also was able to be used for an additional purpose, so mostly used my own filament as to not use too much of the department stock.<br><br>

<br>This was one of the first test prints. Most important lesson is that just because you have room on the plate, doesn't mean you should add something. The mini's needed far different settings (and the finer nozzle), so really didn't turn out well.

<br>Preparing for summer incentives for my middle schooler who is getting into tournament play, stumbled across this design and thought it demonstrated a larger shape well, had supports, but the inset shape and taller walls would display techniques well.
<br>No major issues printing.

<br>With the large flat surface on the bed, glue stick application was extra important here to ensure good adhesion and setup of the first layer.
<br>Ended up printing this multiple (4) times as I had my personal filament supply and this design proved very helpful for helping my son sort his Pokémon cards.

<br>A silly little bench for a dice jail. Example had shown that it could be painted. I also was looking for a project to utilize the "wood" colored filament to demo.

<br>The biggest observation with this one is that thin structures can be risky. The top part of the bench broke removing tree supports and the bottom middle leg also broke. These were easily repaired with superglue, but demonstrated the inherent risk with finer shapes like this. It had also finished around midnight, so supports weren't attempted to be removed till 9 hours later - well behind the 2hr max recommendation.

<br>So consider supports, ability to remove, and shape!

<br>Main element being demonstrated here is a multipart print. It utilizes 4 plates, so has 4 different print runs. This needed to consider timing (to remove pieces from printer, clean plate, gluestick, and start next plate), filament colors, etc. So the one adjustment I made from what was downloaded from the online Bambu source was the order of the plates - so that I could get the shortest ones during the day and the longer one run in the evening.
<br>Pieces fit together fairly well, but utilized some superglue to enhance stability in case of getting bumped.
