<br>Setting up an outlook calendar event and adding a resource
<br>Physical signup sheet (I suggest doing this as well as an indicator, and so if your print is done and you aren't around, and someone else needs to use, they quickly know who to contact.)
<br>Look at the introduction steps below!
<br><br>
<br>Take a look at demo's that have been printed on the computer using a variety of shapes, sizes, techniques, nozzles, purpose, etc.
<br>If you are familiar with Github, feel free to add your own with a pull request on the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/" target="_blank">UJ-3D-Printing repository</a>!

<br>Should be installed on the "Majors Lab" computers


<br>3D Printer is set in LAN mode, so must be on UJ network and then should be able to "add printer" from within Bambu Studio.

<br>Any additional instructions will be added here.


<br>You can add your own print files, find online models using the studio or externally, etc.
<br>
NOTE - Updating and Refining software instructions is key next portion of guide<br>
You can print directly from a memory card in the printer and skip most of these notes.
<br><br>
<br>Utilizing Bambu Studio, set up your print!

<br>Make sure to use the glue stick on the chosen plate
<br>Print - make note of estimated completion time

<br>The estimates are pretty accurate.
<br>Plate changes are not automatic and often print one at a time sort of thing.


<br>Check back in and clean up once done

<br>Wash any residual glue off of plate
<br>Clean up any excess filament 
<br>Let a faculty know if there were any issues, running low on filament, leaving any personal filament, need additional time, etc.

 <br>The printer, the rest we will try to keep some on hand, but if planning to print larger pieces (or dense - using a lot of filament), please ask or purchase your own. (Or see if we can purchase it for you and work with the business office.)<br>We will keep the following on-hand as general use:<br>
<br>Spare parts/nozzles/grease
<br>Smooth and textured plates for printing on
<br>Glue sticks (Very important for bed adhesion!)
<br>3D Printer and AMS

<br>Bambu X1C with AMS 


<br>A small amount of tools, sanding material, and basic supplies we will try to keep on hand. Depending on how quickly those go missing, get used up, etc., they may or may not be available.
<br>Superglue (maybe)

 <br>Filament<br>
<br>If you are going past 5-6hrs of print time, ask. You might want to get your own.
<br>You want a specific color that isn't available or is showing as low, you might want to get your own.
<br>You want something other than PLA. (Also ask so we can review this with you.)
<br>Hardware<br>
<br>At this time we don't keep any hardware for models on hand, so depending on the project you might want (or need) to get additional hardware. That could be...:

<br>Magnets (helps hold things together)
<br>Superglue (may be a small amount in the bins)
<br>Hinges or other such hardware
<br>Paint, plastic filler (some on hand), primer, etc.


<br>Micro SD Card<br>
<br>You may want a Micro SD Card to use for printing files, or saving Timelapse videos of your 3D prints.

 <br>At this time, there is not a Micro SD Card installed to record timelapse video, but I hope to track one down and get it installed soon. You may want to get your own to bring STL files back and forth (you can load and print via the SD Card and skip Bambu Studio) and then to save your timelapse video of your print elsewhere.<br>

 <br>The default nozzle is 0.4mm (this works for most things).<br>
<br>*This seems to work for most. One example of printing a card tray, with no fine details, switching from .04mm to .06mm would reduce print time from 4hr 1min to 3hrs 36min with no discernable difference in quality. You can test different nozzle impacts prior to actually changing.
<br>Nozzle sizes available for the Bambu X1C Printer:<br>
<br>0.2mm hotend

<br>Dr. B's note: this can be pesky, really easy to get "string" results, stuck supports, etc. Expect a higher level of ef


<br>0.4mm (default, spare nozzle on hand)
<br>0.6mm hotend
<br>0.8mm hotend
<br>You decided you do need to swap the Nozzle - here are the steps and links to videos demonstrating how to do it:<br>
<br>Swapping the Bambu Carbon X1C hotend: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f8XW8zZSRo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f8XW8zZSRo</a> (Note both videos will give you the idea, both also include a nozzle replacement, which you shouldn't have to do, just swap the complete hotend for the desired size.)

<br>Take off cover from hotend (magnets hold it there)
<br>Remove 2 screws holding it in place and pull down

<br>The wrench for this will be in the parts box. 


<br>Remove 3 plugs holding it in place (carefully)
<br>Place new nozzle and reverse the above process

 <br>With the AMS it is quick and easy to print with multiple colors! Make sure you have considered the following before designing and printing in multiple colors:<br>
<br>Am I going to paint this?

<br>If you are going to further process after painting - select a base color such as grey, white, or black.


<br>Does it need to be in multiple colors?

<br>Every color switch can add significant time to a print and additional waste material generated.


<br>Do I have access to the colors (or something close) that I want?

<br>Too many colors, even if you have them all on hand (more than 4) can mean pausing, manual filament changes, etc., which all add to risk of something going wrong with a print in addition to the increase time mentioned.

 <br><br>
<br>While some were printed with UJ Dept filament, most were printed with filament purchasing as I didn't want to use up all of the "small project" filament for folks! It doesn't seem like most of these use a lot, but it does add up!
<br>I only used the PLA Filament type ordered from Bambu directly.

<br>UJ has an account there, so can order non-tax.
<br>Bambu reels have an RFID chip in them, so Bambu Studio automatically recognized type and color.
<br>If purchasing your own, see Filament page in the Materials Needed section. In theory any generic 1.75mm filament should work, but your mileage may vary and I have erred on the side of the "certified to work with this printer" stuff from Bambu... but there are neat colors and types from elsewhere.


<br>My "personal stash" of filament order was:

<br>With "bulk" order (over 4), discount, and no tax added, this was around $125 USD of filament, which should last a while. My demo'd listed here below utilized some of the gray/white/black/orange of the department, so likely will go through more filament when using my own stuff. So consider how much you will need, how long it will take to order, etc.

<br>We are still working out how to best "stock" or allow usage of filament. How much should just be accepted as cost of running, when to tell folks they need to order, contribute to cost, etc.


<br>PLA Galaxy Nebula

<br>Liked the color and effect, but glitter higher risk of clogs so didn't use anything smaller than the .4mm nozzle.


<br>PLA Red
<br>PLA Blue
<br>PLA Yellow

<br>Accidentally got the refill one, so had to get creative with respooling on the extra galaxy reel.

<br>With the large flat surface on the bed, glue stick application was extra important here to ensure good adhesion and setup of the first layer.
<br>Ended up printing this multiple times as I had my personal filament supply and this design proved very helpful for helping my son sort his Pokémon cards.

<br>A silly little bench for a dice jail. Example had shown that it could be painted. I also was looking for a project to utilize the "wood" colored filament to demo.

<br>Tintin-style rocket from Bambu Online Models


<br>Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned

<br>The biggest observation with this one is that thin structures can be risky. The top part of the bench broke removing tree supports and the bottom middle leg also broke. These were easily repaired with superglue, but demonstrated the inherent risk with finer shapes like this. It had also finished around midnight, so supports weren't attempted to be removed till 9 hours later - well behind the 2hr max recommendation.

<br>So consider supports, ability to remove, and shape!

<br>Main element being demonstrated here is a multipart print. It utilizes 4 plates, so has 4 different print runs. This needed to consider timing (to remove pieces from printer, clean plate, gluestick, and start next plate), filament colors, etc. So the one adjustment I made from what was downloaded from the online Bambu source was the order of the plates - so that I could get the shortest ones during the day and the longer one run in the evening.
<br>Pieces fit together fairly well, but utilized some superglue to enhance stability in case of getting bumped.
