 <br><br>
<br>Setting up an outlook calendar event and adding a resource
<br>Physical signup sheet (I suggest doing this as well as an indicator, and so if your print is done and you aren't around, and someone else needs to use, they quickly know who to contact.)
<br>Look at the introduction steps below!
<br><br>
<br>Take a look at demo's that have been printed on the computer using a variety of shapes, sizes, techniques, nozzles, purpose, etc.
<br>If you are familiar with Github, feel free to add your own with a pull request on the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/" target="_blank">UJ-3D-Printing repository</a>!
<br>Bambu Studio:<br>
<br>Download link: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio" target="_blank">https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio</a>

<br>Should be installed on the "Majors Lab" computers


<br>3D Printer is set in LAN mode, so must be on UJ network and then should be able to "add printer" from within Bambu Studio.

<br>Any additional instructions will be added here.


<br>You can add your own print files, find online models using the studio or externally, etc.

 <br>The printer, the rest we will try to keep some on hand, but if planning to print larger pieces (or dense - using a lot of filament), please ask or purchase your own. (Or see if we can purchase it for you and work with the business office.)<br>We will keep the following on-hand as general use:<br>
<br>Spare parts/nozzles/grease
<br>Smooth and textured plates for printing on
<br>Glue sticks (Very important for bed adhesion!)

 <br>The default nozzle is 0.4mm (this works for most things).<br>
<br>*This seems to work for most. One example of printing a card tray, with no fine details, switching from .04mm to .06mm would reduce print time from 4hr 1min to 3hrs 36min with no discernable difference in quality. You can test different nozzle impacts prior to actually changing.
<br>Nozzle sizes available for the Bambu X1C Printer:<br>
<br>0.2mm hotend

<br>Dr. B's note: this can be pesky, really easy to get "string" results, stuck supports, etc. Expect a higher level of ef


<br>0.4mm (default, spare nozzle on hand)
<br>0.6mm hotend
<br>0.8mm hotend
<br>You decided you do need to swap the Nozzle - here are the steps and links to videos demonstrating how to do it:<br>
<br>Swapping the Bambu Carbon X1C hotend: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f8XW8zZSRo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f8XW8zZSRo</a> (Note both videos will give you the idea, both also include a nozzle replacement, which you shouldn't have to do, just swap the complete hotend for the desired size.)

<br>Take off cover from hotend (magnets hold it there)
<br>Remove 2 screws holding it in place and pull down

<br>The wrench for this will be in the parts box. 


<br>Remove 3 plugs holding it in place (carefully)
<br>Place new nozzle and reverse the above process

 <br>With the AMS it is quick and easy to print with multiple colors! Make sure you have considered the following before designing and printing in multiple colors:<br>
<br>Am I going to paint this?

<br>If you are going to further process after painting - select a base color such as grey, white, or black.


<br>Does it need to be in multiple colors?

<br>Every color switch can add significant time to a print and additional waste material generated.


<br>Do I have access to the colors (or something close) that I want?

<br>Too many colors, even if you have them all on hand (more than 4) can mean pausing, manual filament changes, etc., which all add to risk of something going wrong with a print in addition to the increase time mentioned.

 <br>Dr. B's demo prints:<br>
<br>While some were printed with UJ Dept filament, most were printed with filament purchasing as I didn't want to use up all of the "small project" filament for folks! It doesn't seem like most of these use a lot, but it does add up!
<br>I only used the PLA Filament type ordered from Bambu directly.

<br>UJ has an account there, so can order non-tax.
<br>Bambu reels have an RFID chip in them, so Bambu Studio automatically recognized type and color.


<br>My "personal stash" of filament order was:

<br>With "bulk" order (over 4), discount, and no tax added, this was around $125 USD of filament, which should last a while. My demo'd listed here below utilzed some of the gray/white/black/orange of the department, so likely will go through more filament when using my own stuff. So consider how much you will need, how long it will take to order, etc.

<br>We are still working out how to best "stock" or allow usage of filament. How much should just be accepted as cost of running, when to tell folks they need to order, contribute to cost, etc.


<br>PLA Galaxy Nebula

<br>Liked the color and effect, but glitter higher risk of clogs so didn't use anything smaller than the .4mm nozzle.


<br>PLA Red
<br>PLA Blue
<br>PLA Yellow

<br>Accidentally got the refill one, so had to get creative with respooling on the extra galaxy reel.
