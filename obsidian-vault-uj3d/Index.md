# UJ 3D Printing Lab Wiki
*This is the landing page for the University of Jamestown's CDC (Computing, Design, and Communication) 3D Printing Lab.*

### Unsure of where to start, but you went to this web address because you were sent a link, scanned a QR code, and want to use the 3D printer... start with the [[01.01 - Getting started]] guide! 

This wiki style site will likely always be a work in progress, but you can help! 

Feel free to submit suggestions, write-ups, discoveries, etc., to a department faculty member.
	- If you are familiar with Github (or wish to learn it, which is a great idea anyways), [go to our repository](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/)! 
	- Wiki is maintained using Obsidian and a plugin that exports the site to HTML, however, that doesn't mean you need to learn or use any of those tools! Everything is stored in Markdown format - so individual files can be updated directly in the "[Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/)," and then pull in when I integrate changes and repush the site to Github!

*When in doubt, send a note to one of the faculty members and we will get you pointed in the right direction*
