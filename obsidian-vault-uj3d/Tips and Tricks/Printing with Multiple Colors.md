With the AMS it is quick and easy to print with multiple colors! Make sure you have considered the following before designing and printing in multiple colors:

- Am I going to paint this?
	- *If you are going to further process after painting - select a base color such as grey, white, or black.*
- Does it need to be in multiple colors?
	- *Every color switch can add significant time to a print and additional waste material generated.*
- Do I have access to the colors (or something close) that I want?
	- *Too many colors, even if you have them all on hand (more than 4) can mean pausing, manual filament changes, etc., which all add to risk of something going wrong with a print in addition to the increase time mentioned.*
