## Dr. B's demo prints:
* *While some were printed with UJ Dept filament, most were printed with filament purchasing as I didn't want to use up all of the "small project" filament for folks! It doesn't seem like most of these use a lot, but it does add up!*
* I only used the PLA Filament type ordered from Bambu directly.
	* *UJ has an account there, so can order non-tax.*
	* *Bambu reels have an RFID chip in them, so Bambu Studio automatically recognized type and color.*
	* If purchasing your own, see Filament page in the Materials Needed section. In theory any generic 1.75mm filament should work, but your mileage may vary and I have erred on the side of the "certified to work with this printer" stuff from Bambu... but there are neat colors and types from elsewhere.
* My "personal stash" of filament order was:
	* With "bulk" order (over 4), discount, and no tax added, this was around $125 USD of filament, which should last a while. My demo'd listed here below utilized some of the gray/white/black/orange of the department, so likely will go through more filament when using my own stuff. So consider how much you will need, how long it will take to order, etc.
		* *We are still working out how to best "stock" or allow usage of filament. How much should just be accepted as cost of running, when to tell folks they need to order, contribute to cost, etc.*
	* PLA Galaxy Nebula
		* *Liked the color and effect, but glitter higher risk of clogs so didn't use anything smaller than the .4mm nozzle.*
	* PLA Red
	* PLA Blue
	* PLA Yellow
		* *Accidentally got the refill one, so had to get creative with respooling on the extra galaxy reel.*

### Project 11 - RPG Dice Timeout Bench
- Description
	- *A silly little bench for a dice jail. Example had shown that it could be painted. I also was looking for a project to utilize the "wood" colored filament to demo.*

	- *Tintin-style rocket from Bambu Online Models*
- Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned
	- *The biggest observation with this one is that thin structures can be risky. The top part of the bench broke removing tree supports and the bottom middle leg also broke. These were easily repaired with superglue, but demonstrated the inherent risk with finer shapes like this. It had also finished around midnight, so supports weren't attempted to be removed till 9 hours later - well behind the 2hr max recommendation.*
		- So consider supports, ability to remove, and shape!

	- *Main element being demonstrated here is a multipart print. It utilizes 4 plates, so has 4 different print runs. This needed to consider timing (to remove pieces from printer, clean plate, gluestick, and start next plate), filament colors, etc.*
