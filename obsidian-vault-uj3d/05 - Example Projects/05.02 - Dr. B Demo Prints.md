## Dr. B's demo prints:
* *While some were printed with UJ Dept filament, most were printed with filament purchasing as I didn't want to use up all of the "small project" filament for folks! It doesn't seem like most of these use a lot, but it does add up!*
* I only used the PLA Filament type ordered from Bambu directly.
	* *UJ has an account there, so can order non-tax.*
	* *Bambu reels have an RFID chip in them, so Bambu Studio automatically recognized type and color.*
	* If purchasing your own, see Filament page in the Materials Needed section. In theory any generic 1.75mm filament should work, but your mileage may vary and I have erred on the side of the "certified to work with this printer" stuff from Bambu... but there are neat colors and types from elsewhere.
* My "personal stash" of filament order was:
	* With "bulk" order (over 4), discount, and no tax added, this was around $125 USD of filament, which should last a while. My demo'd listed here below utilized some of the gray/white/black/orange of the department, so likely will go through more filament when using my own stuff. So consider how much you will need, how long it will take to order, etc.
		* *We are still working out how to best "stock" or allow usage of filament. How much should just be accepted as cost of running, when to tell folks they need to order, contribute to cost, etc.*
	- PLA Galaxy Nebula
		* *Liked the color and effect, but glitter higher risk of clogs so didn't use anything smaller than the .4mm nozzle.*
	* PLA Red
	* PLA Blue
	* PLA Yellow
		* *Accidentally got the refill one, so had to get creative with respooling on the extra galaxy reel.*

With the demo projects, I aimed to use a variety of shapes, length of prints, fine detail vs larger assembled, etc. Much of what I printed also was able to be used for an additional purpose, so mostly used my own filament as to not use too much of the department stock.
### Project 1 - Dice Case
- Description
	- Hex design case to hold 7 ttrpg dice (DnD dice) demonstrating dual color usage with the AMS.

	- [Image 4](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/blob/main/images/dice_case4.jpg)
- Link to STL files (if publicly available)
	- Bambu online search will bring up a lot of dice cases
- Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned
	- Surprisingly straightforward with no real issues. I duplicated the plate so I could print two at once, but that was the only change from the design downloaded.

### Project 2 - Card Box
- Description
	- Printing a Pokémon card box to demonstrate larger scale, mixing colors, thin walls with no supports.
- Link to image(s)
	- [Card Box 1](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/blob/main/images/card_box1.jpg)
	- [Card Box 2](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/blob/main/images/card_box2.JPG)
- Link to STL files (if publicly available)
	- Bambu online search will bring up a lot of versions.
- Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned
	- Also straightforward with no major issues occuring.

### Project 3 - Miniatures

### Project 4 - Dice Tower
- Description
	- A small collapsing dice tower for dice randomization. Two sections friction fit.
- Link to image(s)
	- [Dice Tower](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/blob/main/images/dice_tower.JPG)
- Link to STL files (if publicly available)
	- Downloaded from Bambu online search
- Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned
	- Also duplicated to try printing two, learned about supports with this one.

### Project 5 - Board Game Box Insert
- Description
	- Insert to organize the board game "Green Team Wins."
- Link to image(s)
	- [Board game insert](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/blob/main/images/game_insert.jpg)
- Link to STL files (if publicly available)
	- Searched for specific game via Bambu online
- Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned
	- Seems to be a little hit or miss with board games as to what is available and the difficulty putting it together.

### Project 6 - Travel Yahtzee and Mini's
- Description
- Link to image(s)
	- [Yahtzee 1](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/blob/main/images/yahtzee_box1.JPG)
	- [Yahtzee 2](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/blob/main/images/yahtzee_box2.jpg)
- Link to STL files (if publicly available)
- Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned
	- This was one of the first test prints. Most important lesson is that just because you have room on the plate, doesn't mean you should add something. The mini's needed far different settings (and the finer nozzle), so really didn't turn out well.

### Project 7 - Battle Armadillo
- Description
- Link to image(s)
	- [Battle Armadillo](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/blob/main/images/battle_armadillos.JPG)
- Link to STL files (if publicly available)
- Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned
	- Silly lil figure to test the .2 nozzle. The shape made it very difficult for the underside support removal, but was far more refined above.

### Project 8 - Scaled up Ship
- Description

### Project 9 - Pokémon Booster Pack Dispenser

	- [Booster Pack 2](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/blob/main/images/booster_pack2.jpg)
	- [Booster Pack 3](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/blob/main/images/booster_pack3.JPG)
- Link to STL files (if publicly available)
- Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned
	- Preparing for summer incentives for my middle schooler who is getting into tournament play, stumbled across this design and thought it demonstrated a larger shape well, had supports, but the inset shape and taller walls would display techniques well.
	- No major issues printing.

### Project 10 - Card Sorting Tray
- Description
	- Card sorting tray for things like trading card games, but really could be utilized for anything.
- Link to image(s)
	- [Timelapse Video - Sorting Tray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjITzpzCN8Q)
- Link to STL files (if publicly available)
- Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned
	- *With the large flat surface on the bed, glue stick application was extra important here to ensure good adhesion and setup of the first layer.*
	- *Ended up printing this multiple (4) times as I had my personal filament supply and this design proved very helpful for helping my son sort his Pokémon cards.*

### Project 11 - RPG Dice Timeout Bench
- Description
	- *A silly little bench for a dice jail. Example had shown that it could be painted. I also was looking for a project to utilize the "wood" colored filament to demo.*
- Link to image(s)
- Link to STL files (if publicly available)
	- *Tintin-style rocket from Bambu Online Models*
- Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned
	- *The biggest observation with this one is that thin structures can be risky. The top part of the bench broke removing tree supports and the bottom middle leg also broke. These were easily repaired with superglue, but demonstrated the inherent risk with finer shapes like this. It had also finished around midnight, so supports weren't attempted to be removed till 9 hours later - well behind the 2hr max recommendation.*
		- So consider supports, ability to remove, and shape!

### Project 12 - Tintin Space Rocket

- Link to STL files (if publicly available)
- Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned
	- *Main element being demonstrated here is a multipart print. It utilizes 4 plates, so has 4 different print runs. This needed to consider timing (to remove pieces from printer, clean plate, gluestick, and start next plate), filament colors, etc. So the one adjustment I made from what was downloaded from the online Bambu source was the order of the plates - so that I could get the shortest ones during the day and the longer one run in the evening.*
	- *Pieces fit together fairly well, but utilized some superglue to enhance stability in case of getting bumped.*

### Project 13 - Kallax Modifications
- Description
	- For Kallax cube shelves, adjustable furniture legs, screw hole covers, and brackets to hold two shelves together:

	- NA
- Notes/Observations/Settings/Lessons Learned
	- *No real big issues, however, I did consider strength so increased the print quality from draft to strength and also bumped up the infill percentage.
