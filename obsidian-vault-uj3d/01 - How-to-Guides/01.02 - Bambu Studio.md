## Bambu Studio:
- Download link: https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio
	- *Should be installed on the "Majors Lab" computers*
- 3D Printer is bound to a shared login account (LAN mode with network settings wasn't playing nice).
	- In Bambu Studio, you will need to log into the UJ Account:
		- Username and Password can be located underneath the QR code
		- This should periodically change. 
		- Make sure to log out once complete as I was not able to test the impact of multiple people accessing the printer via multiple mobile and desktop apps - I presume it is a great way to mess things up.

	- *While some settings might be different, has many great tips and tricks for the setup, slicer, etc.*
- You can add your own print files, find online models using the studio or externally, etc.
