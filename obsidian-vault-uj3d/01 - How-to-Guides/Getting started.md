## Booking time to use the printer:
- Setting up an outlook calendar event and adding a resource
- Physical signup sheet (I suggest doing this as well as an indicator, and so if your print is done and you aren't around, and someone else needs to use, they quickly know who to contact.)
- Look at the introduction steps below!

## Demonstration project page
- *Take a look at demo's that have been printed on the computer using a variety of shapes, sizes, techniques, nozzles, purpose, etc.*
- *If you are familiar with Github, feel free to add your own with a pull request on the [UJ-3D-Printing repository](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/)!*

Bambu Studio:
- Download link: https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio
	- *Should be installed on the "Majors Lab" computers*
- 3D Printer is set in LAN mode, so must be on UJ network and then should be able to "add printer" from within Bambu Studio.
	- *Any additional instructions will be added here.*
- You can add your own print files, find online models using the studio or externally, etc.
