## Booking time to use the printer:
- Setting up an outlook calendar event and adding a resource
- Physical signup sheet (I suggest doing this as well as an indicator, and so if your print is done and you aren't around, and someone else needs to use, they quickly know who to contact.)
- Look at the introduction steps below!

## Demonstration project page
- *Take a look at demo's that have been printed on the computer using a variety of shapes, sizes, techniques, nozzles, purpose, etc.*
- *If you are familiar with Github, feel free to add your own with a pull request on the [UJ-3D-Printing repository](https://github.com/ujcs/UJ-3D-Printing/)!*

## Bambu Studio:
- Download link: https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio
	- *Should be installed on the "Majors Lab" computers*
- 3D Printer is set in LAN mode, so must be on UJ network and then should be able to "add printer" from within Bambu Studio.
	- *Any additional instructions will be added here.*
- You can add your own print files, find online models using the studio or externally, etc.

> **NOTE - Updating and Refining software instructions is key next portion of guide**
> **You can print directly from a memory card in the printer and skip most of these notes.**
## Start Printing:
- Utilizing Bambu Studio, set up your print!
	- [[02.01 - What is supplied]]
	- [[02.02 - What do I need to get]]
- Make sure to use the glue stick on the chosen plate
- Print - make note of estimated completion time
	- *The estimates are pretty accurate.*
	- *Plate changes are not automatic and often print one at a time sort of thing.*
- Check back in and clean up once done
	- *Wash any residual glue off of plate*
	- *Clean up any excess filament* 
	- *Let a faculty know if there were any issues, running low on filament, leaving any personal filament, need additional time, etc.*
