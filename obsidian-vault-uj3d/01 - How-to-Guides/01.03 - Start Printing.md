## Start Printing:
- Utilizing Bambu Studio, set up your print!
	- [[02.01 - What is supplied]]
	- [[02.02 - What do I need to get]]
- Make sure to use the glue stick on the chosen plate
	- In Bambu studio you would have chosen the type of plate, textured PEI or Smooth PEI are your options. *(I typically used the textured unless I knowingly wanted a smooth surface.)*
		- Plate is held down by magnets. Remove the plate, add glue stick (helps with removing print once done), place back on the bed, and go!
- Print - make note of estimated completion time
	- *The estimates are pretty accurate.*
	- *Plate changes are not automatic and often print one at a time sort of thing.*
	- If logged into mobile app you can get completion time alerts, remote monitoring, etc. If it isn't your print, avoid doing this so you don't mess things up for someone else by accident!
- Check back in and clean up once done
	- *Wash any residual glue off of plate*
	- *Clean up any excess filament* 
	- *Let a faculty know if there were any issues, running low on filament, leaving any personal filament, need additional time, etc.*
	- Log out of Desktop or Mobile app
