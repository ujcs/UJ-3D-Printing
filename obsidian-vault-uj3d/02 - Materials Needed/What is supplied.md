The printer, the rest we will try to keep some on hand, but if planning to print larger pieces (or dense - using a lot of filament), please ask or purchase your own. (Or see if we can purchase it for you and work with the business office.)

We will keep the following on-hand as general use:
- Spare parts/nozzles/grease
- Smooth and textured plates for printing on
- Glue sticks (Very important for bed adhesion!)
- 3D Printer and AMS
	- Bambu X1C with AMS
