At this time, there is not a Micro SD Card installed to record timelapse video, but I hope to track one down and get it installed soon. You may want to get your own to bring STL files back and forth (you can load and print via the SD Card and skip Bambu Studio) and then to save your timelapse video of your print elsewhere.
