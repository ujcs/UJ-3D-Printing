Filament
- If you are going past 5-6hrs of print time, ask. You might want to get your own.
- You want a specific color that isn't available or is showing as low, you might want to get your own.
- You want something other than PLA. (Also ask so we can review this with you.)

Hardware
- At this time we don't keep any hardware for models on hand, so depending on the project you might want (or need) to get additional hardware. That could be...:
	- Magnets (helps hold things together)
	- Superglue (may be a small amount in the bins)
	- Hinges or other such hardware
	- Paint, plastic filler (some on hand), primer, etc.

Micro SD Card
- You *may* want a Micro SD Card to use for printing files, or saving Timelapse videos of your 3D prints.
