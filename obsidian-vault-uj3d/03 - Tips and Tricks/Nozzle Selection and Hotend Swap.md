The default nozzle is 0.4mm in side.
- *This seems to work for most. One example of printing a card tray, with no fine details, switching from .04mm to .06mm would reduce print time from 4hr 1min to 3hrs 36min with no decernable difference in quality. You can test different nozzle impacts prior to actually changing.

Nozzle sizes available for the Bambu X1C Printer:
- 0.2mm hotend
	- *Dr. B's note: this can be pesky, really easy to get "string" results, stuck supports, etc. Expect a higher level of ef*
- 0.4mm (default, spare nozzle on hand)
- 0.6mm hotend
- 0.8mm hotend
