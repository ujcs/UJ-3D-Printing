The default nozzle is 0.4mm (this works for most things).
- *This seems to work for most. One example of printing a card tray, with no fine details, switching from .04mm to .06mm would reduce print time from 4hr 1min to 3hrs 36min with no discernable difference in quality. You can test different nozzle impacts prior to actually changing.

Nozzle sizes available for the Bambu X1C Printer:
- 0.2mm hotend
	- *Dr. B's note: this can be pesky, really easy to get "string" results, stuck supports, etc. Expect a higher level of ef*
- 0.4mm (default, spare nozzle on hand)
- 0.6mm hotend
- 0.8mm hotend

You decided you do need to swap the Nozzle - here are the steps and links to videos demonstrating how to do it:
- Swapping the Bambu Carbon X1C hotend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f8XW8zZSRo *(Note both videos will give you the idea, both also include a nozzle replacement, which you shouldn't have to do, just swap the complete hotend for the desired size.)*
	- Take off cover from hotend (magnets hold it there)
	- Remove 2 screws holding it in place and pull down
		- *The wrench for this will be in the parts box.* 
	- Remove 3 plugs holding it in place (carefully)
	- Place new nozzle and reverse the above process
- Replacing the nozzle on the hotend (shouldn't have to do this) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA-bvOE72GE
