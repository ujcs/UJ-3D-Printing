Booking time to use the printer:
- Setting up an outlook calendar event and adding a resource
- Physical signup sheet (I suggest doing this as well as an indicator, and so if your print is done and you aren't around, and someone else needs to use, they quickly know who to contact.)
- Look at the introduction steps below!
